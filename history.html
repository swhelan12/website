 <p>Here are 10 short facts about football and what it was like years ago</p>
<div>
<img class="floater" src="old.jpg" style="width:270px;height:225px;margin-left:15px;">
  <br>  
1. During the very first international football match between Scotland and England in 1872, players not only wore knickerbockers or long pants but bobble hats or caps too. The head dresses were a normal part of the footballing attire at the time and lasted well into the 20th century.
  <br>
  <br>
2. Balls were not exactly round when the first club and country matches took place. A pigs bladder was blown up like a balloon, tied at the ends and placed inside a leather case, affording it an egg shape. The discovery of Indian rubber in the 1860s gave the ball greater roundness.
  <br>
  <br>
3. While it is true footballs of yesteryear gained weight in wet conditions, they were in fact lighter than todays ball. In 1889, the spherical object used had to be between 12-15 ounces (340 -425 grams) but this increased to 14-16 ounces (397 -454 grams) in 1937.
  <br>
  <br>
4. In the FA rules of 1863, there was no mention of a crossbar. As in rugby today, a goal could be scored at any height as long as the ball went between the sticks or posts. A tape was used to close the goal during the first internationals before a crossbar replaced it in 1875.
  <br>
  <br>
5. Mob football, a descendant of the modern game, stormed into England around the 12th Century and caught on to such an extent it was banned by Royal decree by many kings and queens. It was a violent game in which murder and manslaughter were allegedly the only barriers to transporting the ball to village ends. King Henry VIII, however, is believed to have been a keen player.

  <br>
  <br>
6. Contrary to some beliefs, football was very much an upper class sport in England during its infancy. The rules of the game were largely drafted by students belonging to public schools and universities. The working class adopted the sport during the late 19th Century.
  <br>
  <br>
7. The first meeting of the Football Association on 26 October 1863 in London did not end in total agreement among the 12 attendees. One club walked out, refusing to accept the non-inclusion of hacking (kicking below the knee) among the original rules.
  <br>
  <br>
8. Early football tactics resembled those of todays rugby. Teams were top-heavy with forwards and because of the offside law, which prevented advanced players touching the ball, attacking often meant players grouping or scrimmaging together around the ball to move it towards goal.The ancient Greek Maradona, playing Episkyros with a pala (National Museum of Archeology in Athens)
  <br>
  <br>
9. Penalties or referees found no place in the original rules of the game. Gentlemen would never intentionally foul, it was assumed. In fact debating techniques were almost as important as ball skills in those days as players could appeal against decisions first to captains and then to umpires before referees, named so because they had originally been referred to by umpires, found their place on the pitch in 1891.
  <br>
  <br>
10. It was only in the 20th Century that the penalty spot was introduced. In the decade before penalties, originally called the kick of death, could be taken anywhere along a line 12-yards from goal.
